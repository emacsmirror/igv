;;; Commentary:
;; The igv package provides a minor mode to control remotely an
;; instance of Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV).  It can load a track
;; file and position IGV at a specified location without leaving
;; Emacs.

;;; Code:

The function must take no argument and must return nil if no location is found, or a string with location of type
\"chr1:nnnnnnn\" or \"chr1:nnnnnn-mmmmmm\" on success.  Two location-search functions are defined in this package:
`igv-search-location-vcf' returns the location of the current line in a vcf file;
`igv-search-location-backward' detects and returns locations of type \"chr1:nnnnnn-nnnnnn\" before point."
